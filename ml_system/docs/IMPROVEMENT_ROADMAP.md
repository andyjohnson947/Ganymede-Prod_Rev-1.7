ML System Improvement Roadmap:

Phase 1 (Next 2-4 weeks):
- Collect 50+ diverse trades
- Validate feature importance
- Analyze recovery mechanism patterns

Phase 2 (1-3 months):
- Deep learning models (LSTM for sequences)
- Reinforcement learning for position sizing
- Multi-objective optimization (profit + risk)

Phase 3 (3-6 months):
- Alternative data (order flow, sentiment)
- Ensemble of strategies
- Adaptive learning systems
